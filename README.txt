Description

    HuckTheme is a product that adds a new style to a Plone 3.x site.

    HuckTheme is based on DIYPloneStyle 3.0, a skeleton product
    ready for building new graphical designs for Plone.

Installation

    On the file system: place HuckTheme in the Products directory
    of your Zope instance and restart the server.

    In the Plone Web Interface: as portal manager, go to 'Portal > Site Setup
    > Add-on Products'.
    Select 'HuckTheme' and click the *Install* button.

    Uninstall -- Can be done from the same page.

Selecting a skin

    Depending on the values given in the skins tool profile (see
    profiles/default/skins.xml), the HuckTheme skin will be selected (or
    not) as default one while installing the product. If you need to switch
    from a default skin to another, go to the 'Site Setup' page, and choose
    'Themes' (as portal manager).

    Note -- Don't forget to perform a full refresh of the page or reload all
    images (not from browser cache) after selecting a skin. In Firefox, you
    can do so by pressing the 'shift' key while reloading the page. In IE, use
    the key combination <Ctrl-F5>.
